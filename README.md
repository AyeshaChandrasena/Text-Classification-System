# Text-Classification-System
This project implements a binary text classification pipeline using:

  1. Hugging Face Transformers for tokenization

  2. Sentence Transformers for generating sentence embeddings

  3. PyTorch for building and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
